# About me
Hello. My name is Ishank Agrawal. I am an American currently living in India for the last 4 years. I am a maths and physics enthusiast, and I love to sketch. Below you can learn more about my favourite sports an hobbies

## Sports
- **Running**: I have been running and participating in cross country and road races for a very long time. I have ran more than 25 races between 2013-2020 of various distances, including 5k, 8k and 10k, in New England (USA), and in Delhi (India). I have even participated in a triathlon hosted by Hale reservation, Westwood MA.
- **Basketball**: I consistently play basketball everyday with my neighborhood friends, trying out new tricks, layups, and combos. We play 3x3 on half court, and we only leave when the mosquitos become unbearable.
- **Snowboarding**: I really miss winter sports after moving to India. I like all manner of winter sports, including snowboarding, skiing, ice hockey, and cross country. Snowboarding and skiing were almost a winter weekend ritual. Here, it is close to impossible to get anywhere below 0 at such frequency.
- **Table Tennis**: Though I had always played basic table tennis with my family, I got introduced to the world of spins, shots, and wild serves when I went to my first math camp. There, I learned the art from my fellow seniors, and after I taught it to my sister. Now, especially in these COVID times, we regullarly play converting our dining table into a tennis table.

## Hobbies
- **Chess**: Chess is one of my favorite activities. My current ranking is 1700+ on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/ishu_agr). Please feel free to challenge me for a game anytime.
- **Sketching**: I love to sketch. You can see some my sketch works [here](/sketches).
- **Piano**: I self taught myself piano. I started from the basics, and now I am quite comfortable at playing level 4 pieces. My form might get strange expressions from music professionals, but I highly enjoy the time spent over each phrase and line.
- **Cooking**: I love to cook, and in my free time you can see me making anything from noodles to pasta to burritos to exotic desserts and more.
