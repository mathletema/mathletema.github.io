# Facts about me

Hi. Below are some facts about me!

**Goals**: Represent USA at the International Physics Olympiad.

**Sports I enjoy**: Table tennis, basketball, skateboarding, snowboarding, and running.

**Non-athletic hobbies**: Chess, cooking, torturing my friends by explaining them random physics stuff.

**Favourite physics theory**: I find thermodynamics really interesting, since in essence it is a statistical theory, and all results are macroscopic rather than microscopic. I also enjoy mechanics lots of every day problems can be solved with just a few equations and really crude approximations. I really love crossovers when physics is used to solve math problems.

**Favourite math subject**: Geomtery, group theory. A recurring theme I find really satisfying is to start with a seemingly trivial construction (like say euclidean plane) and prove highly non-trivial facts (like concurrence and collinearity). This is also a reason why I love number theory as it starts with just a series of numbers but goes on to theorems like Riemann zeta function which hasn't even been proved till date.

**Favourite linux stuff**; distro - Arch Linux, wm - bspwm, bar - polybar. (I will be uploading dotfiles sometime in near future)
