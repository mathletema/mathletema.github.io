# About me
Hello. My name is Ishank Agrawal. I am an American currently living in India for the last 4 years. I am a maths and physics enthusiast, and I love to sketch. Below you can learn more about my favourite sports an hobbies

## Sports
- **Running**: I have been running for a long time. I have ran more than 25 timed races between 2013-2020 in New England (USA) and in Delhi (India). Most of my runs range from 5K to 10K. I have even participated in a triathlon hosted by Hale reservation, Westwood MA.
- **Basketball**: I consistently play basketball everyday with my neighborhood friends, trying out new tricks, layups, and combos. We play 3x3 on half court, and we only leave when the mosquitos become unbearable.
- **Snowboarding**: I miss winter sports after moving to India. I like all manner of winter sports, including snowboarding, skiing, ice hockey, and cross country. Snowboarding and skiing were a winter weekend ritual. Here, it is close to impossible to get anywhere below zero at such frequency.
- **Table Tennis**: When I played table tennis with my family, we would only do simple rallies. I got introduced to the world of spins, shots, and wild serves when I went to my first math camp. There, I learned the art from my fellow seniors. When I came back, I taught it to my sister. Now, in these COVID times, we regularly play using our dining table as a makeshift tennis table.

## Hobbies
- **Chess**: Chess is one of my favorite activities. My current ranking is around 1700 on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/ishu_agr). My cousin, Aaryan Varsheny, is a FIDE master (FM) with 2 IM norms. I always learn something new from him. Feel free to challenge me to a game anytime!
- **Sketching**: I love to draw. You can see some my sketch works [here](/sketches).
- **Piano**: I taught myself piano. I started from the basics, and now I am comfortable playing grade 4 pieces. My form might get strange expressions from music professionals, but I highly enjoy the time spent.
- **Cooking**: I love to cook, and in my free time you can see me making anything from noodles to pasta to burritos to exotic desserts and more.
- **Coding**: Sometimes, when I feel like I have spent a lot of time on a mechanics problem or a combinatorial games problem, I create a simulation and play around with the given constraints. I love to code, and my usual languages are Processing (for graphic), Python, and Javascript canvas. In fact, I coded this entire website myself using jekyll. You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/mathletema/mathletema.github.io). I am currently learning more about algorithms and combinatorics applied to CS.
