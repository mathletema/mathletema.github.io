                <h1>Facts about me</h1>
Hi. Below are some facts about me!
<br> <br>
<b>Goals</b>: Represent USA at the International Physics Olympiad.
<br>  <br>
<b>Sports I enjoy</b>: Table tennis, basketball, skateboarding, snowboarding, and running.
<br> <br>
<b> Non-athletic hobbies </b>: Chess, cooking, torturing my friends by explaining them random physics stuff.
<br> <br>
<b>Favourite physics theory</b>: I find thermodynamics really interesting, since in essence it is a statistical theory, and all results are 
macroscopic rather than microscopic. I also enjoy mechanics lots of every day problems can be solved
with just a few equations and really crude approximations. I really love crossovers when physics is used to solve math problems.
<br> <br>
<b>Favourite math subject</b>: Geomtery, group theory. A recurring theme I find really satisfying is to 
start with a seemingly trivial construction (like say euclidean plane) and prove highly non-trivial facts (like concurrence
and collinearity). This is also a reason why I love number theory as it starts with just a series of numbers but goes
on to theorems like Riemann zeta function which hasn't even been proved till date.
<br> <br>
<b>Favourite linux stuff</b>; distro - Arch Linux, wm - bspwm, bar - polybar. (I will be uploading dotfiles
sometime in near future)
