<p>Hi. Below are some facts about me!</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong>: Represent USA at the International Physics Olympiad.</p>

<p><strong>Sports I enjoy</strong>: Table tennis, basketball, skateboarding, snowboarding, and running.</p>

<p><strong>Non-athletic hobbies</strong>: Chess, cooking, torturing my friends by explaining them random physics stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Favourite physics theory</strong>: I find thermodynamics really interesting, since in essence it is a statistical theory, and all results are macroscopic rather than microscopic. I also enjoy mechanics lots of every day problems can be solved with just a few equations and really crude approximations. I really love crossovers when physics is used to solve math problems.</p>

<p><strong>Favourite math subject</strong>: Geomtery, group theory. A recurring theme I find really satisfying is to start with a seemingly trivial construction (like say euclidean plane) and prove highly non-trivial facts (like concurrence and collinearity). This is also a reason why I love number theory as it starts with just a series of numbers but goes on to theorems like Riemann zeta function which hasnâ€™t even been proved till date.</p>

<p><strong>Favourite linux stuff</strong>; distro - Arch Linux, wm - bspwm, bar - polybar. (I will be uploading dotfiles sometime in near future)</p>
