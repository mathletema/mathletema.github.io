This is the code for my website. I have used jekyll with my own custom theme Ash found [HERE](https://github.com/mathletema/ash).
The portraits and sketches are pulled in from a seperate respostiory found [HERE](https://github.com/mathletema/sketches).

I developed this site on Ubuntu 20.04 with zsh. I really enjoyed developing this website. I learned a lot of things about version control (forks, branches, submodules, filter branches, etc) as well as linux (using wildcards, advanced cmd usage etc). 

If you have any questions, or want some help in setting up your own site, feel free to contact me [HERE](https://mathletema.github.io/contact)!
